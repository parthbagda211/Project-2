# Project Title: Sentiment Analysis using Neural Networks

Project Description:
I used text datasets, Keras, TensorFlow, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a neural network model for sentiment analysis. The model was trained on a dataset of text reviews, and it was able to achieve an accuracy of 0.9624 on a validation dataset. The model was able to correctly identify the sentiment of the text reviews with a high degree of accuracy.
